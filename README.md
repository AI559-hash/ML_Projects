 Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository hosts a collection of distinct machine learning projects, showcasing various applications of data science and predictive modeling. Each project is contained within its own Jupyter notebook, providing a clear and reproducible workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

 1. Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict heart disease.

Objective: To predict the presence of heart disease based on various health parameters.
Key Libraries Used: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`.
Methodology: The notebook involves data loading from `heart.csv`, exploratory data analysis, and the application of classification algorithms. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as the Confusion Matrix.


 2. Weather Prediction with SGDR

This project implements a machine learning model for weather prediction, specifically utilizing the Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor (SGDR) algorithm.

Objective: To predict weather parameters like temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.
Key Libraries Used**: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`.
Methodology: The notebook processes `weather_data.csv`, performs data inspection, and trains a regression model. Model evaluation includes Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² Score to assess predictive accuracy.



 3. Housing Price Prediction

This project tackles the problem of predicting housing prices using a comprehensive machine learning approach.

Objective: To predict median house values based on various features of housing districts.
Key Libraries Used**: `Pathlib`, `Pandas`, `Tarfile`, `Urllib.request`, `Scikit-learn`, `SciPy`.
Methodology: The project involves downloading and loading the `housing.tgz` dataset, performing data preprocessing, and building a regression model. The performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and confidence intervals for predictions.
